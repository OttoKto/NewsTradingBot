üî∏A recent flood of celebrity, political, and animal-themed memecoins, along with a crypto market downturn, may have contributed to a 44% fall in the sale of NFTs in Q2.

üîπAccording to data from @cryptoslamio, NFT sales fell from $4.14B in Q1 to $2.32B in Q2 as part of a broader market downfall.

Multichain self-custody means managing digital assets across different blockchains without relying on third-party services.

It combines self-custody‚Äîwhere users directly control their assets with private keys‚Äîwith the ability to use multiple blockchain networks like $ETH, $SOL, $APT, and $SUI.

Using multichain wallets or decentralized tools, users can manage assets in one place, making the process easier.

Unlike third-party custody, where a company holds private keys for users, self-custody requires individuals to securely store their keys using hardware wallets, software wallets, or other methods. Popular self-custody wallets include Ledger, Trezor, and MetaMask.

This approach is becoming more important as DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain protocols grow, making it essential to manage assets securely across various blockchains.",0.026345418371466464,"[0.04868880659341812, 0.022343385964632034, 0.9289678931236267]",Cointelegraph,0.218315738077546
